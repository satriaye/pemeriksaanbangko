This project is a web-based dashboard designed for real-time monitoring of tax audit performance at local tax offices. I took the initiative to build this application to streamline the performance management process ðŸ˜Š. It tracks key metrics like the number of audit requests, pending audits, completed tasks, audit targets, real-time progress, tax assessment letters, and overall auditor achievements.

With role-based access, both Admin and User can harness the system to efficiently manage and view audit data. The CRUD functionality lets users and admins interact dynamically with the system, giving them control over the information they need.

Built using PHP and the CodeIgniter 3 framework, this app is a straightforward yet powerful solution for tracking and improving tax office operations.
